## Project Description

The Machine Learning Project focuses on processing a dataset related to tire wear and applying various machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and selection of the best-performing model.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding of categorical data.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of multiple machine learning models including MLP, Decision Trees, and more.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve analysis.
- **Model Deployment:** Exporting trained models for future use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreaScarpellini1/ML-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ML-Project
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Notebooks

To run the project:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the `Project.ipynb` file.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

### Viewing the Results

The notebook includes visualization of results such as model performance metrics and predictions.
